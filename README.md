# InformationSystems-Pytorch_vs_Ray
The purpose of this project is to investigate the abilities of Pytorch and Ray in the light of Machine Learning and Distributed Systems applications. In particular, we wrote Python scripts implementing Binary Classification on csv data, the Personalized Page Rank algorithm on a graph and Classification on image data. We took measurements, comparing the aforementioned SÎ¿ftwares.
Read "directions.txt" for directions for the use of the system and see the report "InformationSystemsReport.pdf" for further explanation for the set up. There you can also find the results of the experiments and conclusions.
