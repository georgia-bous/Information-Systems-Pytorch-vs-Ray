1. Go to the data folder and download the data (this might take a while)
2. Install Ray and Pytorch and set up the environment as mentioned in the first segment of the report
3. For the BC task you need to do a preprocessing to the data, just run the 
"preprocessing.py" script, the result will be the input data
4. In each script there is an implementation for reading either from HDFS or from local file.
Adjust as needed.
5a. Run Pytorch application using: 
torchrun --nnodes=2 –node_rank=(0 ή 1) –master_addr=<private IP of master> --master_port=<random unused port> filename.py
5b. Run Ray application using:
python3 filename.py
